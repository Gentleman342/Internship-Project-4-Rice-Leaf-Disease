# Project Name :- Rice Leaf Disease 
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy, achieving a commendable 75.00% on the rice leaf disease dataset. This outcome suggests that CNNs are effective in handling the complexities of the data, despite the reported difficulty in processing it. The success of CNNs in this context highlights their capability to capture intricate patterns and features within the dataset, making them a suitable choice for image-based classification tasks such as identifying diseases in rice leaves. Despite the challenges in data processing, the CNN model proved to be robust and yielded the best results, emphasizing its potential for accurate classification in similar domains
